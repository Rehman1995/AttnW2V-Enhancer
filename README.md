AttnW2V-Enhancer: Leveraging Attention and Word2Vec for Enhanced Enhancer Prediction
Accurate identification of enhancer regions in DNA sequences is a critical task for understanding gene regulation and its role in various biological processes. Enhancers are regulatory elements that can influence gene expression, but their identification remains a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of DNA sequences. In this paper, we propose the AttnW2V-Enhancer model, which addresses this challenge by combining Word2Vec-based sequence encoding, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and attention mechanisms. Our approach leverages Word2Vec embeddings to capture biologically relevant patterns in DNA sequences, offering a more efficient and interpretable representation compared to traditional encoding methods such as One-Hot Encoding and physicochemical representations. The performance of AttnW2V-Enhancer is evaluated on an independent test set, and it demonstrates superior performance, achieving the highest accuracy (81.75), sensitivity (83.5), specificity (80.00), and MCC (0.635) compared to existing models. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of the attention mechanism, which enhances feature learning by dynamically focusing on relevant regions of the sequence. The results confirm that integrating Word2Vec encoding with CNN and attention mechanisms provides a powerful framework for enhancer prediction, offering valuable insights into regulatory sequence identification.
